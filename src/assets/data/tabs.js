And what about the water molecule makes it so useful for life?</p><p>Oceans moderate the temperatures and weather patterns on Earth. Much of the freshwater on Earth is ice, which provides essential regulation of Earth’s climate and weather. </p> <p>Water is a critical part of life-sustaining chemical reactions in all living organisms. Water in the bodies of humans and other animals stabilizes body temperature and provides a medium for nourishment and for signals to travel through the body. Water also allows for substances to move through plants and is a vital part of photosynthetic reactions.</p><p><b>Investigate properties of water, and compare them to the properties of other liquids, to find out why water is important for life on Earth.</b></p>',
